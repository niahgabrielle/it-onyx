      <div class="output">
      <p>Hi, I'm Saniah Thompson, and is a current sophomore at UALR. I am also on our <strong>collegiate dance team</strong>. We are called the <em>Trojans in Motion</em>. We cheer, stomp, and dance at all home basketball games, both women and men. It took me lots of hard work to earn a spot on the team. I started off as a beginner just like you. The tv show <em>Shake It Up: Chicago</em> inspired me so much to become a dance, just like Zendaya. I started stretching a lot to get more flexible, and then started to practice some dance moves. Those moves slowly became choreography, which then became short performances in front of family. After having the support behind me to achieve my dream of dancing, my parents registered me for a peewee dance team when I was eight years old. From there, I've been dancing ever since. From peewee to camps to comeptitive to high school to collegiate. If I can do it, so can you. My next steps after graduating are to audition for dance roles or become part of an NFL dance squad.</p>
